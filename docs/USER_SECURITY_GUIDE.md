# Keeping Your Graceful Books Account Secure

## Your Security Matters to Us

At Graceful Books, we have built a **zero-knowledge encryption system** that means even we cannot see your financial data. Your numbers, your client names, your invoices - all of it is encrypted before it ever leaves your device. Only you hold the key.

But security works best as a partnership. This guide will walk you through, step by step, how you can help keep your account safe. Take your time reading through it - there is no rush, and these practices will serve you well.

## Your Passphrase: The Key to Everything

### Why It Is So Important

Think of your passphrase as the master key to a safe that only you can open. When you create your passphrase:

1. Your device uses it to generate encryption keys
2. These keys scramble all your financial data
3. The scrambled data syncs to our servers
4. We store only the scrambled version - we cannot unscramble it

**This means:** We do not store your passphrase. We cannot reset it for you. We cannot recover it if you forget it. This is not a limitation - it is how we guarantee that your data stays private.

### Creating a Strong Passphrase

A strong passphrase protects your data from anyone trying to guess their way in. Here is what makes a good one:

**Do use:**
- A phrase that is meaningful to you but not obvious to others
- At least 4-6 words strung together
- A mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Something you can remember without writing it down

**Examples of strong passphrases:**
- `My3CatsLove2EatTuna!`
- `BlueMountain-Coffee$Morning`
- `2024WasThe!YearIStartedMyBusiness`

**Avoid:**
- Single words, even with numbers (`Password123`)
- Personal information others might know (birthdays, pet names, addresses)
- Common phrases (`ILoveYou`, `LetMeIn`)
- Passphrases you use for other accounts

**Helpful tip:** The strength meter during setup shows you how secure your passphrase is. Aim for the green zone - that is when you know you have chosen something solid.

### Storing Your Recovery Key

During account setup, we offer you the option to create a **recovery key**. This is a set of 24 words that can restore access to your account if you ever forget your passphrase.

**If you choose to create a recovery key:**

1. **Write it down on paper** - Do not just save it digitally where hackers could find it
2. **Store it somewhere safe** - A locked drawer, a safe, or a safety deposit box
3. **Keep it separate from your devices** - If someone steals your laptop, they should not also get your recovery key
4. **Consider making a backup copy** - Store it in a different secure location
5. **Never share it with anyone** - Not even someone claiming to be from Graceful Books

**Important:** We will never ask you for your recovery key. Anyone who does is trying to steal your account.

**If you choose NOT to create a recovery key:**

This gives you the highest level of privacy - absolute zero-knowledge. But it also means that if you forget your passphrase, your data is permanently unrecoverable. There is no back door, no override, no exception. Make sure you are comfortable with this trade-off.

## Recognizing Security Threats

Bad actors are creative, but their tricks often follow patterns. Here is what to watch for.

### Phishing Attempts

Phishing is when someone pretends to be us (or another trusted company) to trick you into revealing your passphrase or recovery key.

**Red flags to watch for:**

- **Unexpected emails** asking you to "verify your account" or "update your security"
- **Urgent language** like "Your account will be suspended in 24 hours!"
- **Unfamiliar sender addresses** - our emails come from `@gracefulbooks.com`
- **Links that look slightly wrong** - hover over them before clicking (e.g., `gracefulb00ks.com` instead of `gracefulbooks.com`)
- **Requests for your passphrase or recovery key** - we will NEVER ask for these

**What to do if you receive a suspicious email:**

1. Do not click any links in the email
2. Do not download any attachments
3. Go directly to Graceful Books by typing our address into your browser
4. Check your account from there to see if any action is actually needed
5. Report the suspicious email to us at security@gracefulbooks.com

### Social Engineering

Social engineering is when someone manipulates you into giving up information or access. This can happen over email, phone, or even in person.

**Watch for people who:**

- Claim to be tech support and need your passphrase to "fix" something
- Say they are from Graceful Books and need to "verify" your identity
- Create a sense of urgency ("We need this RIGHT NOW or you will lose your data")
- Offer to help you with something you did not ask for help with

**Remember:** Graceful Books staff will never:
- Ask for your passphrase
- Ask for your recovery key
- Ask you to install remote access software
- Pressure you into making quick decisions about your account

If something feels off, it probably is. Take a breath, hang up or close the chat, and contact us directly through our official website.

## Best Practices

### Device Security

Your device is the gateway to your data. Keep it secure.

**Keep your devices updated:**
- Install operating system updates when prompted - they often include security fixes
- Keep your browser up to date
- Enable automatic updates when possible

**Use screen locks:**
- Set a PIN, password, fingerprint, or face recognition on all your devices
- Set your screen to lock automatically after a few minutes of inactivity
- Lock your device when you step away, even briefly

**Be thoughtful about where you access your account:**
- Avoid using public or shared computers for Graceful Books
- If you must use a shared computer, always log out completely and close the browser
- Be aware of who might be able to see your screen (shoulder surfing)

### Browser Security

Your web browser is your window to Graceful Books. Keep it clean and current.

**Keep your browser updated:**
- Modern browsers update automatically - make sure this feature is enabled
- Updates include important security patches

**Using shared or public devices:**
- Use private/incognito mode so your session is not saved
- Clear browsing data when you are done (history, cookies, cached files)
- Never save your passphrase in the browser on a shared device
- Log out completely before closing the browser

**Browser extensions:**
- Only install extensions from trusted sources
- Review your installed extensions periodically and remove ones you do not use
- Some extensions can see everything you type - be cautious

### Network Security

How you connect to the internet matters.

**Public WiFi caution:**
- Avoid accessing Graceful Books on public WiFi (coffee shops, airports, hotels)
- If you must use public WiFi, use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for protection
- Public networks can be monitored by others

**Your home network:**
- Use a strong, unique password for your WiFi network
- Keep your router's firmware updated
- Consider using WPA3 encryption if your router supports it

**Mobile data:**
- Your phone's cellular data is generally safer than public WiFi
- But still be aware of your surroundings when entering your passphrase

## What To Do If...

### You Think Your Account Is Compromised

If you suspect someone else has gained access to your account, take these steps:

1. **Stay calm** - Quick, clear action is more effective than panic
2. **Change your passphrase immediately** from a device you trust
3. **Review recent activity** in your account for anything you do not recognize
4. **Check your devices** - run antivirus/malware scans
5. **Contact us** at security@gracefulbooks.com to report the incident
6. **If you have other users**, consider whether they need to be notified

**Good news:** Because of zero-knowledge encryption, even if someone accessed our servers, they would only see encrypted data they cannot read without your passphrase.

### You Forgot Your Passphrase

Take a deep breath. Here are your options:

**If you created a recovery key:**
1. Go to the Graceful Books login page
2. Click "Forgot Passphrase"
3. Follow the prompts to enter your 24-word recovery key
4. Create a new passphrase
5. Your data will be decrypted and re-encrypted with your new passphrase

**If you did NOT create a recovery key:**
We understand this is difficult to hear, but without a recovery key, there is no way to recover your data. This is the nature of zero-knowledge encryption - the privacy that protects you from us also means we cannot help you bypass your own security.

Your options are:
- Keep trying to remember your passphrase (there is no penalty for trying)
- Create a new account and start fresh
- If you have exported reports or backups, you may be able to reference those

We know this is frustrating. We wish we could help more, but building in a back door would compromise the security of everyone who uses Graceful Books.

### You Lost Your Recovery Key

If you still know your passphrase, you are okay. Here is what to do:

1. Log into your account with your passphrase
2. Go to Settings then Security
3. Generate a new recovery key
4. Store the new key safely (see our tips above)
5. Your old recovery key is now invalid

**If you have lost your recovery key AND forgotten your passphrase:** Unfortunately, this combination means your data is unrecoverable. See the section above about forgotten passphrases.

### You See Suspicious Activity

If you notice something unusual in your account:

1. **Document what you see** - Take screenshots if possible
2. **Change your passphrase** as a precaution
3. **Review your account settings** - Check that email addresses and other details are correct
4. **Contact us** at security@gracefulbooks.com with details about what you observed

We take every report seriously and will investigate promptly.
