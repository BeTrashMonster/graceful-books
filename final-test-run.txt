Warning: An update to TreeNode inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {
  /* fire events that update state */
});
/* assert on the output */

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://reactjs.org/link/wrap-tests-with-act

Warning: An update to TreeNode inside a test was not wrapped in act(...).

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

When testing, code that causes React state updates should be wrapped into act(...):

act(() => {

This ensures that you're testing the behavior the user would see in the browser. Learn more at https://reactjs.org/link/wrap-tests-with-act
