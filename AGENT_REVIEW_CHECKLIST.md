# Agent Review Checklist

This checklist must be followed by every agent before implementation work begins and verified before marking tasks complete.

## Pre-Implementation Review

### 1. Requirements Understanding
- [ ] Read and understand the roadmap item's acceptance criteria
- [ ] Review spec references and ensure alignment
- [ ] Identify all dependencies and verify they are complete
- [ ] Understand the joy opportunities and delight details
- [ ] Review external dependencies (libraries needed)

### 2. Architecture Review
- [ ] Review existing codebase structure for similar features
- [ ] Identify where new code should live (services, components, etc.)
- [ ] Check for existing utilities or helpers that can be reused
- [ ] Plan database schema changes if needed
- [ ] Review type definitions needed

### 3. Test Strategy Review
- [ ] Understand required test coverage from roadmap
- [ ] Plan unit tests for core logic
- [ ] Plan integration tests for data flow
- [ ] Plan E2E tests for user workflows
- [ ] Identify edge cases and error scenarios

## Implementation Review

### 4. Code Quality
- [ ] Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- [ ] Use TypeScript properly with no `any` types
- [ ] Add proper error handling
- [ ] Include logging for debugging
- [ ] Follow SOLID principles

### 5. Security & Privacy
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data (user financial data)
- [ ] Follow zero-knowledge architecture principles
- [ ] Validate all user inputs
- [ ] Prevent injection attacks (SQL, XSS, etc.)
- [ ] Add audit logging for financial changes

### 6. User Experience
- [ ] Implement DISC-adapted messaging where appropriate
- [ ] Follow progressive disclosure patterns
- [ ] Add helpful error messages (never blame user)
- [ ] Include tooltips/help for accounting terms
- [ ] Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility

### 7. Testing
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Write integration tests for data persistence
- [ ] Write E2E tests for critical workflows
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Test coverage meets requirements (>80%)

## Post-Implementation Review

### 8. Documentation
- [ ] Update relevant README files
- [ ] Document API/service interfaces
- [ ] Add code comments for complex logic
- [ ] Update type definitions
- [ ] Document any breaking changes

### 9. Integration
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Check for performance regressions
- [ ] Verify encryption of sensitive fields
- [ ] Test offline-first functionality

### 10. Roadmap Updates
- [ ] Mark acceptance criteria as complete
- [ ] Update status in roadmap
- [ ] Check off all completed items
- [ ] Document any known limitations
- [ ] Note any follow-up work needed

## Final Validation

### 11. Quality Gates
- [ ] All tests passing (100%)
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Performance acceptable (page load <2s)
- [ ] Works offline

### 12. User Value
- [ ] Feature solves user problem clearly
- [ ] Joy opportunities implemented
- [ ] Delight details included
- [ ] Error states are helpful not scary
- [ ] Feature feels "Graceful"
